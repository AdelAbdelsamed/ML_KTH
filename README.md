# Machine Learning - DD2421 (Autumn 2023)

Repository for the Machine Learning (ML) coursework. This repository contains the programming assignments and the programming challenge for the DD2421 course at KTH in the autumn term of 2023.
## Course Overview

This coursework consists of three sets of programming assignments.

### Programming Assignments

1. **Assignment 1 - Decision Trees**
MONK Dataset is used to train and validate the implmented Decision Trees Models and the effect of pruning is studied.

3. **Assignment 2 - Support Vector Machines**
Implementation of Support Vector Machine Models from scratch. Models are trained and validated on generated data.

5. **Assignment 3 - Naive Bayes and Ensemble Methods**
Implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier and the Adaboost algorithm. Models are trained and validated on the Iris and Vowel Datasets and their respective performance compared.
  
  ### Programming Challenge
  Multi-class Classification Problem to demonstrate understanding of the whole course. Dataset was pre-processed and analyzed and model selection was performed after the testing of over 20 models.
